# Content Quality Evaluation

## Eval C: Direct Content Comparison (3 queries)

Side-by-side comparison of raw-web-search vs WebSearch output. Judged by: which output would help Claude produce a better answer?

### Query 1: "rust async await best practices"

**WebSearch output (~700 tok):**
- Well-organized with headers (Core Principles, Avoid Blocking, Concurrency Patterns)
- Mentions key concepts: .await, lazy futures, Send trait, join!, deadlocks
- Generic — reads like a tutorial summary
- No code examples, no specific API references

**raw-web-search output (~873 tok):**
- Raw excerpts from official Rust async book and blog posts
- Contains actual Rust concepts in context: cooperative scheduling, blocking operations, tokio specifics
- Links to official documentation and working group roadmap
- Less organized but more technically precise

**Verdict: raw-web-search wins for technical queries.** The verbatim excerpts from the official Rust async book contain precise technical language that Claude can quote directly. WebSearch's synthesis is correct but generic — it loses the specific guidance about tokio, cooperative scheduling, and the nuances that matter for implementation.

### Query 2: "CRISPR gene editing mechanism explained"

**WebSearch output (~650 tok):**
- Clear 3-step mechanism: recognition, cleavage, repair
- Explains Cas9 as "molecular scissors"
- Mentions key components (guide RNA, PAM site, double-strand breaks)
- Well-structured, reads like a textbook summary

**raw-web-search output (~391 tok):**
- First result is a partial page from Synthego (broad, less focused)
- Second result is a PMC snippet with the 3-step mechanism (brief)
- Third result is an Addgene snippet (one line)
- Less content overall, fragmented across sources

**Verdict: WebSearch wins for broad science questions.** The AI-synthesized answer is more coherent and complete. Our tool returned less content (391 tok) and it was scattered across sources without the connecting narrative. For questions where users want an overview, synthesis helps.

### Query 3: "microservices vs monolith architecture tradeoffs"

**WebSearch output (~800 tok):**
- Structured comparison with pros/cons for each
- Mentions ACID transactions, fault tolerance, deployment independence
- Includes "when to use each" guidance
- Comprehensive but generic

**raw-web-search output (~534 tok):**
- First result from getdx.com cites academic research with specific findings
- Second result from AWS has structured comparison headers
- Third result from Reddit has practitioner perspective
- Mix of authoritative sources + real-world experience

**Verdict: Tie.** WebSearch is more organized. Our tool provides more diverse perspectives (academic research, cloud vendor docs, practitioner Reddit discussion). For an LLM synthesizing an answer, having multiple viewpoints is arguably more valuable than one pre-synthesized summary.

### Summary: Eval C

| Query Type | Winner | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Technical/code | **raw-web-search** | Verbatim excerpts preserve precise technical language, code context, API specifics |
| Broad science | **WebSearch** | AI synthesis produces more coherent overviews for introductory questions |
| Architecture/design | **Tie** | We provide diverse perspectives; WebSearch provides organized synthesis |

**Overall assessment:** For Claude Code's primary use case (helping developers write code), our tool produces better content because it preserves the technical precision that matters for implementation. For general knowledge questions, WebSearch's synthesis is more readable but loses specifics.
